# ASSIsT 
## An Automatic SNP ScorIng Tool for in- and out-breeding species

ASSIsT is a tool for efficient filtering of Illumina
Infinium/BeadExpress based SNP markers. This software can analyse
different kind of experimental populations: Cross Pollinated (CP –
F1), Back Cross (BC), F2 and collections of unrelated individuals
(Germplasm). It is possible to export the filtered data in several
formats according to the most widely used software for marker-trait
association analysis.


## Getting started

	git clone https://github.com/diegomic/ASSIsT.git
	cd ASSIsT
	python ASSisT_1_02.py
