# ASSIsT: An Automatic SNP ScorIng Tool for in- and out-breeding species

ASSIsT is a tool for efficient filtering of Illumina
Infinium/BeadExpress based SNP markers. This software can analyse
different kind of experimental populations: Cross Pollinated (CP –
F1), Back Cross (BC), F2 and collections of unrelated individuals
(Germplasm). It is possible to export the filtered data in several
formats according to the most widely used software for marker-trait
association analysis.


## Getting started

ASSIsT is written in Python; therefore, it can run virtually in any platform with
python installed.

## Installation

The Windows executables is distributed as a zip archive. It not necessary to in-
stall ASSIsT, just extract the ASSIsT\_Windows.xx.zip archive (xx is the version
number).
The source code is a collection of Python scripts. They can be executed from
any operating system with Python 2.7 installed. The following additional Python
modules are needed to run the software:
   - PyQt4 (v.4.8)
   - NumPy (v.1.8 or higher)
   - matplotlib (v.1.3 or higher)
   - SciPy (v.0.14 or higher)

## Running ASSIsT

 Windows: double click on ASSIsT.exe to start ASSIsT. 
 Source code: execute ASSIsT.py from a command line shell.
